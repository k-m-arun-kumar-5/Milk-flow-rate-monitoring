Description
===========
   The rotating shaft gives rise to a pulse train. Determine flow rate from pulse train . Pulse train is given as a input to counter. As an output, bargraph is displayed, giving the operator on every period for specified time, a visual representation of the flow rate on that period. On every period of specified time, an audible alarm, which will sound when the flow rate on that period falls below an acceptable level. For simulation purpose, pulse train is feed to switch, not to a counter. Flow rate is directly proportional to toggling speed of operation of switch between 0 and 1. 

CAUTION:
========
Schematics and simulation is done by using Proteus CAD. NOT EXPERIMENTED IN REAL TIME ENVIRONMENT.

Purpose :
=========
In all my respective repositories, I just shared my works that I worked as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentations and all other related files and some programming that might not being implement, not being completed, lacks some features or have some bugs. Purpose of all my repositories, if used, can be used for learning and educational purpose only. It can be used as the open source and freeware. Kindly read the LICENSE.txt for license, terms and conditions about the use of source codes, binaries, documentation and all other files, located in all my repositories. 

My Thanks and Tribute :
========================
I thank to my family, Friends, Teachers, People behind the toolchains and references that I used, all those who directly or indirectly supported me and/or helped me and/or my family, Nature and God. My tribute to my family, Friends, Teachers, People behind the toolchains and references that I used, Nature, Jimmy Dog, God and all those, who directly or indirectly help and/or support me and/or my family.
