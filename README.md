Description
===========
   The rotating shaft gives rise to a pulse train. Determine flow rate from pulse train . Pulse train is given as a input to counter. As an output, bargraph is displayed, giving the operator on
every period for specified time, a visual representation of the flow rate on that period. On every period of specified time, an audible alarm, which will sound when the flow rate on that period falls
below an acceptable level. For simulation purpose, pulse train is feed to switch, not to a counter. Flow rate is directly proportional to toggling speed of operation of switch between 0 and 1. 

CAUTION:
========
Schematics is done by Proteus. NOT EXPERIMENTED IN REAL TIME ENVIRONMENT.
