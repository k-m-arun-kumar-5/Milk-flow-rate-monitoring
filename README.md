Description
===========
   The rotating shaft gives rise to a pulse train. Determine flow rate from pulse train . Pulse train is given as a input to counter. As an output, bargraph is displayed, giving the operator on every period for specified time, a visual representation of the flow rate on that period. On every period of specified time, an audible alarm, which will sound when the flow rate on that period falls below an acceptable level. For simulation purpose, pulse train is feed to switch, not to a counter. Flow rate is directly proportional to toggling speed of operation of switch between 0 and 1. 

CAUTION:
========
Schematics and simulation is done by using Proteus CAD. NOT EXPERIMENTED IN REAL TIME ENVIRONMENT.

Purpose :
=========
In all my respective repositories, I just shared my works that I worked as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentations and all other related files and some programming that might not being implement, not being completed, lacks some features or have some bugs. Purpose of all my repositories, if used, can be used for learning and educational purpose only. It can be used as the open source and freeware. Kindly read the LICENSE.txt for license, terms and conditions about the use of source codes, binaries, documentation and all other files, located in all my repositories. 

Autography :
============
I, K.M. Arun Kumar alias Arunkumar Murugeswaran, in the year 2003, graduated (B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering (EIE) at Government College of Technology (GCT), Coimbatore, India), was a C developer, with 2 years of work experience (2003-2005) at a company, based in Chennai, India, as a network programmer (using C programming language), in a role of Software engineer in Design & Development Team, in domain of Remote Access Server (RAS) in module of Point to Point Protocol (PPP), Telnet and SS7. I resigned from that company, due to work stress that I was unable to bear, which affected my health and then treatment given by a doctor, which was not suitable for my health, worsen my health. After a rehabitation process in my health, thanks to my mother, sister and family, healthcare, myself, god and all those who directly or indirectly help and/or support me and my family, which helped me to recover my health. I again practiced and refresh C programming.
 
I have a career break from 2005 - 2023, in 2018-2019, I also learned some Embedded C Programmming using ATMEL AT89C51, PIC16F887, PIC18F4680 and LPC2138 to practice Embedded C programmming and searched for the job. But in vain, mainly due to my career break and my age. 

I just shared my works that I used as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentations and all other related files. 
  
My Thanks and Tribute :
========================
I thank to my family, Friends, Teachers, People behind the toolchains and references that I used, all those who directly or indirectly supported me and/or helped me and/or my family, Nature and God. My tribute to my family, Friends, Teachers, People behind the toolchains and references that I used, Nature, Jimmy Dog, God and all those, who directly or indirectly help and/or support me and/or my family.

Toolchains that I used for AT89C51 Application design and development are as follows :
======================================================================================
1: IDE and Simulator for Application development of  AT89C51           - Keil uvision 4 for C51 Development Tools
2: Desktop Computer Architecture and OS for development of  AT89C51    - Intel X64 & Windows 8.1 (64 bit).
3: Code editor                                                         - Notepad++.
4: Documentation                                                       - Microsoft Office 2007 (alternative LibreOffice) and Text Editor.

Some reference that I refered for AT89C51 Application design and development, are as follows :
